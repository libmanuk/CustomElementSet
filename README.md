# OHMSElementSet
This plugin adds the custom OHMS Oral History element set to Omeka.  This element set includes metadata required for use with the SPOKEdbo oral history theme (https://github.com/libmanuk/Spokedbo) and additional OHMS plugins (OHMSObject: https://github.com/libmanuk/OHMSObject & OHMSImport: https://github.com/libmanuk/OHMSImport).
